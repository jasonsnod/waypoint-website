It was purchased in 1973 by Rob Detzel, who first saw it in an issue of Family Circle. He made arrangements for its display at a home and garden show, then took it on a tour of sorts; in 1987, it landed (er, it was delivered) to its current location. The community embraces its presence and the Futuro House has even been included in a mural titled "Love the Cov" by Jarrod Becker, on the wall at Kroger’s Covington location. In 2013, Covington''s Mayor Sherry Carran declared Nov. 2 — the 40th anniversary to its purchase by Detzel — "Futuro House Day," officially naming the property it is on "Area 89."
