# Waypoint App

This project is an application helping users to find landmarks within Cincinnati and build efficient travel itineraries between chosen landmarks. 

Any site visitor will be able to see all the listed landmarks as well as where they are on a map. A registered user who is logged in will then be able to add the landmarks to an itinerary. This itinerary is an efficient route through the chosen landmarks.
